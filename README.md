🛒 PriceWise – AI Powered E-Commerce Decision Assistant

PriceWise is a smart web application that helps users make better online shopping decisions by comparing real-time product prices across multiple e-commerce platforms and recommending the best deals using AI-assisted logic.

This project was developed as a mini project by a team of 3 as part of our academic coursework and served as our first hands-on experience with web scraping, backend APIs, and AI-assisted decision systems.

🚀 Features

🔍 Search products using just the product name

🌐 Scrapes real-time data from multiple e-commerce websites

💰 Compares price, discount, and overall value

🧠 Uses AI-assisted logic to rank and recommend the best deal

🖥️ Simple and user-friendly frontend interface

🧠 Motivation & Learning

When we started this project, we had very minimal practical knowledge of:

Web scraping

Backend API development

Real-time data handling

Implementing this project was challenging, but it helped us learn by doing.
By completing the project, we gained confidence in building an end-to-end system and significantly improved our technical understanding.

This project played a key role in moving us from theory to real-world application.
